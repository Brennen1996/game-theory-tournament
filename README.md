# game-theory-tournament
In this tournement, multiple teams compete against each other in a Axelrod (cooperate/defect) setting, making wide use of competitive game theory.
The "Tournament_Markdown_Group_16_v2.html" file introduces the tournement and guides through the strategies used and the reasoning behind these strategies.
The "Group 16 Agent.R" file has the actual strategies encoded in the R language.
This project is part of the course Data Analytics & Visualisation (EPA1315)
